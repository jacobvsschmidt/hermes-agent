"""Kanban decomposer — fan a triage task out into a graph of child tasks.

Invoked by ``hermes kanban decompose [task_id | --all]`` and the gateway
dispatcher's auto-decompose path. Reads the profile roster (with
descriptions), asks the auxiliary LLM for a task graph in JSON, then
atomically creates the children, links them under the root, and flips the
root ``triage -> todo``. The root stays alive as parent of every leaf child so
it wakes back up when the graph completes and its assignee (the orchestrator
profile) can judge completion and add more work.

Mirrors ``kanban_specify`` (lazy aux import, lenient parse, never raises on
expected failures). ``fanout=false`` collapses to the ``specify`` behaviour
(tighten + promote, no children), making ``decompose`` a strict superset.
Unknown assignees are rewritten to ``default_assignee`` — a child NEVER ends
up with ``assignee=None``.

Dependency semantics (the SAB v2-migration lesson, ``t_4fc1c39a``): the child
graph must mirror REAL data dependencies. A sequential/phase pipeline
(install -> implement -> post/integrate -> review -> verify) is emitted as a
parent CHAIN, never as flat siblings, so the dispatcher cannot start a review
or verify card before the implementation it checks exists. The system prompt
below encodes this rule; the DB layer (``kanban_db_graph``) enforces it by
leaving a ``todo`` child un-promoted until every parent is ``done``.

Ownership semantics (the split-migration lesson, ``t_783d9174``): a coherent
change to a deployed service must end in ONE integration/deploy card whose
parents are every implementation child, and ONLY that card may write to the
production host. Implementation children land their work in the repository on
the one feature branch (commit -> PR); the deploy card deploys from that
committed branch. A direct, uncommitted edit on a prod host is drift — the
prompt below tells the decomposer to flag and reconcile it, never to build on
it.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the Kanban decomposer for the Hermes Agent board.

A user dropped a rough idea into the Triage column. Your job is to break it
into a small graph of concrete child tasks and route each one to the best-
matching profile from the available roster.

You will be given:
  - The original task title and body
  - The list of available profiles (each with name + description)
  - The fallback "default_assignee" used when no profile fits

Output a single JSON object with this exact shape:

  {
    "fanout": true,
    "rationale": "<one sentence on why this decomposition>",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "title": "<concrete task title, imperative voice, <= 80 chars>",
        "body":  "<detailed spec for the worker on this child task>",
        "assignee": "<profile name from the roster, or null for default>",
        "parents": [<int>, ...]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

Rules:
  - "parents" is a list of INDICES (0-based) into this same "tasks" list,
    expressing actual data dependencies. Tasks with no parents run in
    PARALLEL. Tasks with parents wait until every parent completes.
  - Model real dependencies, not convenience order. Before emitting each
    child, ask: "does this task consume an artifact, decision, or code that
    another child produces?" If yes, that other child MUST be listed in this
    child's "parents".
  - Prefer parallelism ONLY for work that is genuinely independent: if two
    tasks can run at the same time without one consuming the other's output,
    give them no parents so the dispatcher fans them out at once.
  - Recognize SEQUENTIAL / PHASE pipelines and encode them as a parent CHAIN
    (a "spine"), NEVER as flat siblings. When the work has ordered phases
    where each phase consumes the previous phase's output — e.g.
    install/setup -> implement/change -> integrate/post -> review -> verify —
    the later task MUST list the earlier one in "parents" (chain:
    tasks[1].parents=[0], tasks[2].parents=[1], tasks[3].parents=[2], ...).
    A migration, deploy, or any "do X, then Y, then Z" flow is sequential.
  - A verification, review, or live-verify task is ALWAYS downstream of the
    task it checks: its "parents" MUST include the implementation task (directly
    or through the chain), so the dispatcher cannot start it before the code /
    artifact exists. NEVER emit a review/verify task as a sibling with no
    parents. A verify card that runs before its implementation is physically
    impossible to complete.
  - When unsure whether two tasks are independent, prefer the dependency edge.
    A child that waits slightly too long is recoverable; a review/verify that
    runs before its implementation is not.
  - ONE COHERENT CHANGE TO A DEPLOYED SERVICE MUST END IN AN INTEGRATION/DEPLOY
    CARD. When two or more children are parts of the SAME change to one running
    service (e.g. a new order-signer in one card and a new order-client in
    another, both for the same live order path), emit an explicit
    integration/deploy card whose "parents" list EVERY implementation child
    (parents: [i, j, ...]). The change must land as ONE coordinated unit, never
    as separate pieces that drift apart, and the integration card waits until
    all of them are done.
  - "ONE HOST WRITER" — ONLY the integration/deploy card may write to the
    production host or run a deploy. No implementation child touches the live
    host; it lands its change in the repository on the ONE feature branch
    (commit -> PR). The deploy card deploys FROM that committed branch, so the
    running service and the repository never disagree.
  - NEVER emit a task that edits a production host directly. An edit applied on
    the host that is not in the repository is DRIFT, not a fix: the next
    repo-based deploy silently reverts it. If you find (or a child reports) an
    uncommitted host edit, emit a task to RECONCILE it — commit it into the
    feature branch (or revert it) — and never build further on the uncommitted
    state. A change that lives only on one host is invisible to review and lost
    on the next deploy.
  - Use 2-6 tasks for normal work. Don't create 20 tiny tasks. Don't
    cram everything into 1 task.
  - Pick assignees from the roster by matching the task to the profile's
    DESCRIPTION (not just the name). When nothing matches well, use null
    and the system will route to the default_assignee.
  - Each child task body is what a fresh worker will read with no other
    context — be specific about goal, approach, and acceptance criteria.

When the task is genuinely a single unit of work (no useful decomposition),
return:

  {
    "fanout": false,
    "rationale": "<one sentence>",
    "title": "<tightened title>",
    "body":  "<concrete spec for a single worker>",
    "assignee": "<profile name from the roster, or null for default>"
  }

In that case the task stays as one work item, just with a tightened spec and
a concrete assignee. If no profile fits, use null and the system will route to
the default_assignee.

No preamble, no closing remarks, no code fences. Output only the JSON object.
